{"body":"This is a simple container for object mapping\r\n\r\n[On NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/antix-mapping)\r\n\r\nWhen you map your objects you get the container passed into the mapper too, this means you can call other mappings from inside your mapping and keep your code all nice and DRY\r\n\r\n### Basic Example\r\n\r\n    _mapperContainer = new MapperContainer();\r\n\r\n    _mapperContainer\r\n        .Register<Person, PersonEntity>(\r\n            (f, t, c) =>\r\n                {\r\n                    f.Name = t.Name;\r\n                    c.MapAll(f.Addresses, () => t.Addresses);\r\n                })\r\n        .Register<Address, AddressEntity>(\r\n            (f, t, c) => { t.Name = f.Name; }\r\n        );\r\n\r\nIn this example the registered Address => AddressEnity mapper is called for the collection of Addresses on the person\r\n\r\nSee the tests for more examples","note":"Don't delete this file!
